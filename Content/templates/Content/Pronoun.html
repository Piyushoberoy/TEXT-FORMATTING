						<FONT size="6px">TYPES OF PRONOUNS</FONT>
					</u><B>
						<dt>Object Pronouns: </dt>
						<dd> Object pronouns work as the object or indirect object in a sentence replacing the
							antecedent object. This form of the pronoun is also used after prepositions. Examples:-
						</dd>

						<ul>
							<li>
								<Font color="black"> He</font>has gone to his grandparents.
							</li>
							<li> Marta is a good storyteller.<Font color="black"> She </Font>told a ghost story that
								scared everyone. </li>
						</ul>

						<ul>
							<li>I’ll give <Font color="black">you </font>a present on your birthday. </li>
							<li> I have a gift for your boss. Give it to your boss. (Here, ‘it’works as an object)
								<Font color="black">it</font>
								to your boss. (Here, ‘it’works as an object)
							</li>
						</ul>


						<dt>Subject pronouns </dt>
						<dd>Subject pronouns work as the subject of the verb in a sentence. A subject pronoun normally
							replaces the subject/object (a noun) of the previous sentence. Examples:-</dd>
						<ul>
							<li>

								<Font color="black">He </font>has gone to his grandparents.
							</li>

							<li>
								Marta is a good storyteller.<Font color="black">
									She </Font>told a ghost story that scared everyone.
							</li>

						</ul>



						<dt>Possessive Pronouns: </dt>
						<dd>Possessive pronouns replace the nouns of the possessive adjectives: my, our, your, her, his,
							their. The possessive pronouns are mine, ours, yours, hers, his, its, theirs. The pronoun
							‘who’ also has a possessive form, whose. Examples:-</dd>
						<ul>
							<li>Those four suitcases are ours.
								<Font color="black">ours.</font>
							</li>

							<li>Is this <Font color="black">yours? </font>
							</li>

						</ul>




						<dt>Reflexive Pronouns:</dt>
						<dd>Reflexive pronoun redirects a sentence or a clause back to the subject, which is also the
							direct object of that sentence. A reflexive pronoun comes when the subject performs its
							action upon itself. Here, ‘itself’ is a reflexive pronoun. Examples:-</dd>
						<ul>
							<li>He has great <Font color="black">herself </font>more time to get ready. </li>

							<li>The computer restarts <Font color="black">itself </font> every night.
							</li>
						</ul>


						<dt>Intensive Pronouns:</dt>

						<dd>Intensive pronouns add emphasis/importance but do not act as the object in the sentence.
							They can appear right after the subject.Examples:-</dd>
						<ul>
							<li>I <Font color="black">myself</font> saw the missing boat into the harbor. </li>

							<li>We intend to do all the work<Font color="black">ourselves.</font>
							</li>
						</ul>



						<dt>Relative Pronouns:</dt>
						<dd>Relative pronouns introduce the relative clause. They are used to make clear what is being
							talked about in a sentence. They describe something more about the subject or the object.
						</dd>
						<ul>
							<li>The car <font color="black">that</font> was stolen was the one they loved most.</li>
							<li>A person <font color="black">who </font>loves nature is a good person.</li>
						</ul>


						<dt>Demonstrative Pronouns:</dt>
						<dd>Demonstrative pronouns normally indicate the closeness of or distance from the speaker,
							either literally or symbolically. This, these, that, and those are the demonstrative
							pronouns. They also work as demonstrative adjectives when they modify a noun. However,
							demonstrative pronouns do not modify anything rather replace the nouns/noun phrases.
							Examples:-
							<ul>
								<li>
									<font color="black">That </font> is a long way to go. (demonstrative pronoun)
								</li>


								<li>This <font color="black">is my car.</font>
								</li>
							</ul>

						</dd>


						<dt>Interrogative Pronouns:</dt>
						<dd>Interrogative pronouns produce questions. They are what, which, who, whom, and whose.
							Who, whom, and whose refer to questions related to a person or animal; what refers to an
							idea, object, or event; and which can indicate either a person/s or a thing/s.</dd>

						<ul>
							<li>
								<font color="black">What</font> was the name of your dog?
							</li>
							<li>
								<font color="black">Whom </font>do you prefer in this competition?
							</li>
						</ul>
